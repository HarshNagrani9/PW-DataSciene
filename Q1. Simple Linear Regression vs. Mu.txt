Q1. R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (the target) that can be explained by the independent variables (predictors) in the model. In other words, it quantifies how well the model fits the observed data.

R-squared is calculated using the formula:
\[R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}\]
where:
- SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals) is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values by the model.
- SST (Total Sum of Squares) is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.

R-squared values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit. A value of 1 means that the model explains all the variance in the data, while a value of 0 means that the model doesn't explain any of the variance.

Q2. Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors (independent variables) in the model. It penalizes the addition of unnecessary variables that do not improve the model's fit. Unlike regular R-squared, which tends to increase as more predictors are added, adjusted R-squared can decrease if adding a new variable doesn't significantly improve the model's performance.

The formula for adjusted R-squared is:
\[Adjusted \ R^2 = 1 - \frac{(1 - R^2) \cdot (n - 1)}{n - k - 1}\]
where:
- \(R^2\) is the regular R-squared.
- \(n\) is the number of observations.
- \(k\) is the number of predictors in the model.

Adjusted R-squared provides a more realistic assessment of a model's goodness of fit when you are comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

Q3. Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate when you are comparing regression models with different numbers of predictors. It helps you select the model that strikes a balance between goodness of fit and model complexity. A higher adjusted R-squared indicates that the model explains more variance relative to its complexity. So, if you want to avoid overfitting and select a more parsimonious model, you should use adjusted R-squared for model selection.

Q4. In the context of regression analysis:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** is a metric that measures the average magnitude of the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) while taking into account their squared values. It is calculated as the square root of the mean of squared residuals.
  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** is similar to RMSE but does not take the square root, making it sensitive to large errors. It's calculated as the mean of squared residuals.
  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** measures the average magnitude of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE and MSE.

These metrics help assess the accuracy and performance of a regression model, with lower values indicating better performance.

Q5. Advantages and disadvantages of these metrics in regression analysis:

Advantages:
- **RMSE** and **MSE** give higher weight to larger errors, making them useful when large errors are critical.
- **MAE** is more robust to outliers, providing a better representation of the typical error.

Disadvantages:
- **RMSE** and **MSE** are sensitive to outliers and penalize them heavily.
- **MAE** may not emphasize the importance of larger errors, which could be crucial in some applications.
- The choice of metric should be based on the specific problem and the importance of different types of errors.

Q6. Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression equation. Lasso stands for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator." It differs from Ridge regularization in the type of penalty it applies. In Lasso regularization, the penalty term added to the cost function is the absolute sum of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (alpha).

The key differences between Lasso and Ridge regularization are:
- Lasso tends to produce sparse models by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most important features. Ridge tends to shrink coefficients towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero.
- Lasso is useful for feature selection, as it can automatically exclude irrelevant predictors from the model.

The choice between Lasso and Ridge regularization depends on the problem and the desired properties of the model.

Q7. Regularized linear models, like Lasso and Ridge, help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression cost function. This penalty discourages the model from fitting noise in the data by penalizing large coefficients. Here's an example:

Imagine you have a linear regression model with many predictors, some of which are noise and not related to the target variable. Without regularization, the model might assign substantial coefficients to these noise predictors, leading to overfitting. When you introduce Lasso or Ridge regularization, the penalty term encourages the model to shrink the coefficients of these irrelevant predictors towards zero. As a result, the model becomes more parsimonious and less prone to overfitting, as it focuses on the most important predictors.

Q8. Limitations of regularized linear models:

1. **Feature Selection Bias**: Lasso can lead to feature selection, which is advantageous for reducing model complexity but may exclude potentially relevant features if not used judiciously.

2. **Tuning Complexity**: Choosing the right regularization parameter (alpha) can be challenging, and it requires cross-validation or other techniques.

3. **Assumption of Linearity**: Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between predictors and the target variable, which may not hold in all cases.

4. **Interpretability**: As coefficients are penalized and can be driven to zero, the interpretability of the model may be compromised.

5. **Not Suitable for Highly Correlated Predictors**: Ridge and Lasso may not perform well when predictors are highly correlated because they tend to distribute the penalty across correlated variables.

6. **Limited to Linear Relationships**: Regularized linear models may not capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data.

Q9. Choosing between RMSE and MAE depends on the specific context and the importance of different types of errors. 

- If you want to give more weight to larger errors and consider them more critical, you should choose **RMSE**. In this case, Model A with an RMSE of 10 might be preferred if the magnitude of errors is a significant concern.

- If you want a metric that is more robust to outliers and treats all errors equally, you should choose **MAE**. In this case, Model B with an MAE of 8 might be preferred because it has smaller errors on average, which may be more desirable in some situations.

It's important to consider the domain and application-specific requirements when selecting the evaluation metric. There are no universal rules, and the choice should align with the goals of the analysis.

Q10. The choice between Ridge and Lasso regularization depends on the specific problem and the desired properties of the model:

- **Model A (Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1)** would be preferred if you want to maintain
