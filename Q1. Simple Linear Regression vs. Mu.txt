Q1. **Simple Linear Regression vs. Multiple Linear Regression:**

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (response). The relationship is assumed to be linear, meaning that changes in the independent variable are associated with a constant change in the dependent variable. The model equation is typically represented as Y = a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, 'a' is the intercept, and 'b' is the slope.

    Example: Predicting a student's exam score (Y) based on the number of hours they studied (X).

- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship but considers the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable while holding the others constant. The model equation becomes Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn, where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent variables, 'a' is the intercept, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the slopes.

    Example: Predicting a house's price (Y) based on factors like square footage (X1), number of bedrooms (X2), and location (X3).

Q2. **Assumptions of Linear Regression:**

The key assumptions of linear regression are:
1. **Linearity:** The relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear.
2. **Independence:** Residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity:** Residuals have constant variance across all levels of the independent variables.
4. **Normality:** Residuals follow a normal distribution.
5. **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.

To check these assumptions, you can perform diagnostic tests like scatterplots for linearity, residual plots for homoscedasticity, Q-Q plots for normality, and correlation matrices for multicollinearity. Additionally, hypothesis tests and statistical measures can help assess the assumptions.

Q3. **Interpreting Slope and Intercept:**

- **Slope (b):** It represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable while holding all other variables constant. A positive slope indicates a positive relationship, and a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.

- **Intercept (a):** It represents the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are set to zero. It's the starting point of the regression line.

Example: In a salary prediction model, if the slope for years of experience is 2.5 and the intercept is $40,000, it means that for each additional year of experience (holding other factors constant), a person's salary is expected to increase by $2,500, and someone with zero years of experience is expected to earn $40,000.

Q4. **Gradient Descent:**

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the cost or loss function of a model. It works by iteratively adjusting model parameters (weights and biases) to find the values that minimize the cost function. The core idea is to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters and update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to reach a minimum.

Gradient descent is used in training various machine learning models, including linear regression, neural networks, and deep learning models. It helps the model learn the optimal parameters by adjusting them step by step based on the error between predictions and actual outcomes.

Q5. **Multiple Linear Regression:**

Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It allows you to assess how each independent variable contributes to the variation in the dependent variable while controlling for the effects of other variables. The model equation is:

Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn

Where:
- Y is the dependent variable.
- X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent variables.
- 'a' is the intercept.
- b1, b2, ..., bn are the slopes for each independent variable.

The key difference from simple linear regression is the inclusion of multiple independent variables, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the relationships between variables.

Q6. **Multicollinearity in Multiple Linear Regression:**

Multicollinearity refers to a situation in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It can cause issues in the model, including unstable coefficient estimates and difficulty in interpreting the importance of individual predictors.

To detect multicollinearity, you can:
- Calculate correlation coefficients between independent variables.
- Use variance inflation factor (VIF) calculations. High VIF values indicate multicollinearity.
- Visualize correlation matrices or scatterplots.

To address multicollinearity, you can:
- Remove one of the highly correlated variables.
- Combine correlated variables into a single variable.
- Use dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA).

Q7. **Polynomial Regression:**

Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that allows for modeling nonlinear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Instead of fitting a straight line, polynomial regression fits a polynomial curve to the data. The model equation is:

Y = a + b1X + b2X^2 + ... + bnX^n

Where:
- Y is the dependent variable.
- X is the independent variable.
- 'a' is the intercept.
- b1, b2, ..., bn are coefficients for each term of the polynomial.

Polynomial regression can capture more complex relationships in the data, making it suitable when the linear assumption in simple linear regression is inadequate.

Q8. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression:**

Advantages:
- Can model complex, nonlinear relationships.
- Provides a better fit to the data when the relationship isn't linear.
- Flexible and versatile for various data patterns.

Disadvantages:
- Can overfit the data, leading to poor generalization.
- The choice of the polynomial degree is subjective and can affect results.
- Interpretation of coefficients becomes more challenging with higher-degree polynomials.

Use Polynomial Regression:
- When there is clear evidence of a nonlinear relationship.
- For exploratory data analysis to understand complex patterns.
- In cases where a linear model doesn't capture the underlying phenomenon well.
